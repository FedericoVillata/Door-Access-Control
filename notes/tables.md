## EVERY table needs a univoque key:

this will help to find add/delete/modify elements :
In this way a new page is needed to add/delete elements, which will work with few elements:


- button find USER_ID :
- successive print labels to print the univoque lines

- a second list of empty fields to add values, and **MAYBE** perform add or modify:
    In this cases is needed to check the correct user id/company, that is univoque
